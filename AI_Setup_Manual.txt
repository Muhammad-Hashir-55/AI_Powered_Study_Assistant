one important note is that
some policy concerns i cannot share the gemini api key
but do not worry generate your own gemini API key by visiting the following URL
https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

then afer this step create apig.py file
then add a simple variable named as s
the file should be one line(recommended)
s = 'your_gemini_api_key'
this must only have one line of code in this
this is it and you are good to use this project under license.
